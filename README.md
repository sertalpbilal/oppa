oppa!
====

Optimization Performance Profiler Appliance (**oppa!**) is a toolbox of scripts to generate performance profile graphics for comparing optimization algorithms and software.

**oppa!** uses Elizabeth D. Dolan and Jorge J. More's proposed performance profile method.

Currently **oppa!** has scripts for following languages:

- Matlab

## How to use?

Copy the oppa.m file to the source folder of your data, or add oppa.m's path. Then call
''oppa(X)''
for performance measure matrix X.

## Test

In the test folder, run
''randtest''.
